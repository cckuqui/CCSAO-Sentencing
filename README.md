 ## Data

For this project, we wanted to analyze the sentencing data from Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office (CCSAO). The sentencing data reported by CCSAO ([found here](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Courts/Sentencing/tg8v-tm6u)) reflects the judgment imposed by the court on people that have been found guilty. Each row represents a charge that has been sentenced.
