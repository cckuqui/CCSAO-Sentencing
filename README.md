## Background
In early 2018, the State’s Attorney (judicial prosecutor’s office) in Cook County, Illinois – where the city of Chicago is located – made public a series of unfiltered datasets on all felony criminal cases processed in Cook County, as part of an initiative to increase transparency in the criminal justice system. The case-level datasets contain anonymized information about every felony case processed by the State’s Attorney’s Office (SAO) dating back to roughly 2010, and have been provided for free so that any person or group can analyze the data and share the results publicly.

There are 4 datasets, representing the four stages of interaction with the SAO during the legal process:
1. A demographic analysis of persons found “guilty” of a felony charge (i.e. age, race, gender)
2. An analysis of the types of sentences imposed, possibly disaggregated by type of offense
3. An evaluation of the total time needed in the judicial process to arrive at the final sentence
4. An evaluation of the number of guilty findings and types of sentences grouped by the court or district where the case was processed
  
The project tried to take advantage of a dataset publicly available for free in both downloadable format (csv) and through an API url.  There is a strong interest by the SAO in Cook County to encourage the public to analyze the data, but the SAO does not have the resources to do this analysis directly.</p>


## Data

For this project, we wanted to analyze the sentencing data from Cook County State’s Attorney’s Office (CCSAO). The sentencing data reported by CCSAO ([found here](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Courts/Sentencing/tg8v-tm6u)) reflects the judgment imposed by the court on people that have been found guilty. Each row represents a charge that has been sentenced.
